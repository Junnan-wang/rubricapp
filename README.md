# RubricApp

RubricApp is a web application for evaluating students' professional skills, such as teamwork and communication. With RubricApp, instructors can assess teams of students in real-time using [research-based rubrics](http://elipss.com/) or custom rubrics. Instructors can email students their results, as well as download the data for analysis.

## Install requirements with pip (for development or deployment)

```
# from the base directory
./setup-with-pip.sh
```

## Running the application

### With Flask's test web server

```
cd building_user_login_system-master/finish
python app.py `pwd`      
# or replace pwd with the directory you want the db file and users directory to live

This will print out some logging information, including a localhost URL (probably http://127.0.0.1:5000/). Go there in your web browser to see the site.
```

### With Apache
