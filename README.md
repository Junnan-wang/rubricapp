# RubricApp

RubricApp is a web application for evaluating students' professional skills, such as teamwork and communication. With RubricApp, instructors can assess teams of students in real-time using [research-based rubrics](http://elipss.com/) or custom rubrics. Assessment data is available for download by the instructor and can be emailed to students.
